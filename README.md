The game was made in compliance with an academic requirement. It uses a linked list to store and update the coordinates of interconnected small boxes that comprise the entire snake. Using vectors would have been a better alternative. However, to showcase my ability to apply what I have learned in our class, I made the game using a linked list structure  instead.
